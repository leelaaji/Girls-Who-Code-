  <strong > About Me:
</strong>
  My name is Leela and I am a rising Junior at International High School. I was born and raised in San Francisco and I love the city more than anything. I live with my parents and my younger brother. Living in the city has changed me to become the person I am today. I have been able to develop a sense of independence and understanding of the world around me.
<p> <strong>Interests:
</strong>
  I am very interested in design  and creative technology. I hope to do something design and architecture related for my career. I enjoy things that are organized, aesthetic, & convenient, and I hope to create things that meet these three objectives.  I created this website at a summer immersion program called Girls who Code. I have begun learning coding in python and javascript. I decided to learn more about computer science, because I know these skills will be useful for my future.
